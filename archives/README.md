# Archives Directory

This directory contains archived files and historical versions of project components.

## Files

### Historical Dockerfiles
- `Dockerfile-Original` - Original Dockerfile before optimizations and restructuring

## Purpose

This directory preserves important historical versions of files that have been replaced or significantly modified during the project's evolution. These files serve as:

- Reference for understanding project evolution
- Backup copies of working configurations
- Historical context for development decisions

## Note

Files in this directory are for reference only and may not be compatible with the current project structure. Use the current versions in the main project directories for active development.
